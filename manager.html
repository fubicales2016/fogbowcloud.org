      	<h1>The fogbow manager</h1>
<p>The manager is the fogbow component that runs in each federation member to expose its private cloud to the federation. It provides an API for clients (end users or programs) and interacts with its associated <a href="http://www.fogbowcloud.org/rendezvous">rendezvous service</a>, as well as with other managers through the exchange of <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> messages.</p>
<p>Fogbow's API is inspired by the API that <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> uses to provide access to its <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html">spot instances</a>, and follows the <a href="http://occi-wg.org/">OCCI</a> standard. It provides OCCI extensions for asynchronous requests and federation operations. This implementation provides a unique feature that allows end users to create requests for large amounts of instances, typically beyond what can be provided by the private cloud to which the client has access. We are working closely with <a href="http://ogf.org/">OGF’s</a> OCCI-wg to incorporate these extensions to the standard. </p>
<p>A client interacts with the federation by sending requests to one of its fogbow managers to which it has access. Requests for multiple instances are then treated individually. That is to say, the client will immediatelly receive handlers for as many requests as the number of instances requested, and these requests will eventually materialize into the allocation of a VM instance. When that happens, the client can access the appropriate informations about a particular instance through the request handler that was received initially. This handler can also be used to monitor the request state, eg. to discover when a VM has been started.</p>
<p>There are two types of requests: one-time and persistent. The lifecycle of a request, no matter what is its type, starts in the open state, and evolves to the deleted-without-instance state. After reaching the latter state the request is eventually removed from the system.</p>
<p>For one-time requests, once the request is fulfilled, if the associated VM instance is lost, i.e. deleted by the client or pre-empted by the provider, the request is automatically closed.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Lifecycle of one-time requests" src="{filename}/images/one-time.png" /></center></p>
<p>For the persistent requests, if the VM instance associated to a request that was fulfilled is lost, the request goes back to the open state, and a new VM instance can be associated to it. The client needs to delete a persistent request, when VM instances associated to that request are no longer needed.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Lifecycle of persistent requests" src="{filename}/images/persistent.png" /></center></p>
<p>Instances are allocated to pending requests as follows. While there are available resources, the manager will create instances in the underlying local private cloud. Thereafter, it tries to reclaim resources in the local cloud that are being used to serve remote requests coming from other fogbow managers, and uses these resources to fulfil the local request. If these resources are still not enough to fully serve the request, the fogbow manager contacts the other fogbow managers and tries to obtain from them the extra resources needed. When a fogbow manager receives a request from another fogbow manager, it offers any idle resources available in its local cloud to fulfil the remote request. If these are not enough, the fogbow manager uses some prioritization policy to decide whether resources previously allocated to other fogbow managers should be reclaimed for serving the newly received request. This is done in such a way as to optimize the objective function – e.g. fairness – defined by the federation as a whole, or by each individual member. Clients can start using the instances created as soon as they become available. Open requests are rescheduled regularly until they are fulfilled or no longer valid, ie. the client has deleted them.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The manager component was designed to be agnostic to the underlying cloud technology. There is an interoperability plugin layer between this component and the cloud, in a sense that plugins are responsible for translating fogbow requests to what the underlying cloud understands. Plugins are instantiated via reflection, and fully configured via the configuration file.</p>
<p>Managers interact with each other to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request instances;</li>
<li>Get detailed information about remote instances;</li>
<li>Remove remote instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the <a href="#manager-protocol">manager protocol</a> documentation for more information.</p>
<p>A manager will also interact with a rendezvous service. Those interactions will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send liveness messages;</li>
<li>List active federation members.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more details at the <a href="http://www.fogbowcloud.org/rendezvous">rendezvous protocol</a> documentation.</p>
<h2>Basic functioning</h2>
<p>When a client requests resoures, it is able to specify a request type, which can be <strong>one-time</strong> or <strong>persistent</strong>, default set to <strong>one-time</strong>. A one-time request is fulfilled at most once, whilst a persistent one is considered for scheduling whenever it has no instance allocated to it and it is still into the validity period. This way, new instances are created for <strong>persistent</strong> requests whose instances have failed.</p>
<p>Once an end user makes a request, the possible request states are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> The request is active but it has no instance allocated to it;</li>
<li><strong>Failed:</strong> The request failed because bad parameters were specified;</li>
<li><strong>Fulfilled:</strong> The request is currently active and has an associated instance;</li>
<li><strong>Deleted:</strong> The request was deleted, but it still has an associated instance;</li>
<li><strong>Closed:</strong> The request either completed (an instance associated to a <strong>one-time</strong> request was launched and subsequently was interrupted or terminated), or was not fulfilled within the period specified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authentication/Authorization</h2>
<p>A manager is able to allocate VM instances on its associated local private cloud using a user of this cloud specially configured for this purpose by the administrator of the local private cloud. In particular, the administrator autonomously defines the usage policies that apply to this user, eg. the quota that is assigned to it. We will refer to this special user as the fogbow user.</p>
<p>A user of the fogbow federation - referred as a federation user - acquires VMs by interacting with a particular fogbow manager. The process of authentication and authorization involves two levels: the Federation Level, in which the fogbow manager will authenticate federation users and authorize them to create requests in the federation, and the Local Level, used by the underlying cloud services to authenticate users (fogbow or federation users). If the user is not authenticated or authorized at the federation level, than it will not be able to request VMs. Otherwise, it is able to request VMs to the fogbow manager that uses the fogbow user to request resources on behalf of the federation user. Additionally, if the federation user is also authenticated and authorized at the local level, it can request additional resources using its local user.</p>
<p>Authorized federation users may request as many VMs as needed, even if this number is well above their local quota. At first, the fogbow manager will try to create VMs locally within the local user quota. If there are not enough resources available or the federation user is not authenticated or authorized in the local cloud, the fogbow manager will use the fogbow user to request VMs. Again, when there is no more resources available, the fogbow manager will contact other federation members to create VMs in remote private clouds. The remote members, in turn, will use their fogbow user to create VMs for remote requests.</p>
<p>There is a third level of authentication and authorization that involves only the fogbow managers, or members. Federation members exchange X.509 certificates when joining a fogbow federation, and those are used in the authentication and authorization process that tells if a member may ask for or donate resources to a remote member.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Currently, fogbow provides a set of plugin implementations that is able to interact with an OCCI-enabled OpenStack. Plugins for the standard OpenStack API and OpenNebula are under development.</p>
<p>The manager is responsible for three periodic activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submitting open requests:</strong> the manager submits all open requests periodically; the rescheduling interval is configurable in the manager configuration file;</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring instances:</strong> the manager checks all instances that it is aware of and identifies when an instance is no longer active; then it updates the state of the corresponding request according to its type (one-time|persistent); the instance monitoring period is also configurable in the manager configuration file;</li>
<li><strong>Reissuing requests' tokens:</strong> the manager updates requests' tokens when this is needed; when a request was issued by a user of the underlying cloud, it is aware of the access token being used. However this access token can expire before the request gets fulfilled, or before the valid_until attribute. In this way, the manager updates the request's token when it is necessary. The token update period is configurable in the manager configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client can interact with a manager component to perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>List the federation members;</li>
<li>Get a token access id;</li>
<li>Request instances;</li>
<li>List requests;</li>
<li>Delete requests;</li>
<li>List instances;</li>
<li>Delete instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a fogbow command line interface that helps users to interact with a manager. Please, check its <a href="http://www.fogbowcloud.org/fogbow-cli">documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Manager protocol</h3>
<p>All communication among Managers is done via XMPP, according to the manager protocol.</p>
